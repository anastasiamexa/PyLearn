# PyLearn
A desktop and a web application to help someone learn Python.

As part of the course "Educational Software", we developed a desktop and web application called PyLearn.

## Features
- Users can create and log into their account.
- Read the theory chapters.
- Test their knowledge in practice tests.
- Complete the final test and get their score.
- Teachers and students can check their progress.

## Tech
For this application we used the Visual Studio environment using ASP.NET and .NET technologies. The database used is PostgreSQL and we used the Nicepage 
platform for the web UI.

## Documentation
The file [Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/PyLearn/blob/main/Documentation.pdf) contains a detailed description of the methods used to create the 
application and [User Manual.pdf](https://github.com/anastasiamexa/PyLearn/blob/main/User%20Manual.pdf) the user manual (in Greek).
